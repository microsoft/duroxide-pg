# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (for example, label or comment).
Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once
across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

## Reporting security issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development workflow

Before opening a pull request, run the checks relevant to your change:

```bash
cargo nextest run
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

If `cargo-nextest` is not available, use `cargo test` as a fallback. PostgreSQL-backed tests require `DATABASE_URL` to point to a test database.
